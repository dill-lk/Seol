# SEOL Artificial Feelings — Experiment Log

This file is the **agent-maintained changelog** for model iterations and test outcomes.

## Editing Rules
- Keep each version in its own section (`v1`, `v2`, ...).
- Write a short changelog first.
- Append important test outputs in readable blocks.
- Keep large raw console dumps in separate artifacts when possible.

## Agent Review — 2026-04-04

### What was checked
- Readability and structure of the v8 notes.
- Presence of concrete issues for next iteration planning.
- Consistency between recorded metrics and summary text.

### Changelog (agent)
- Rewrote this file into a clean, structured Markdown format.
- Preserved the key v8 results and major warnings.
- Added a compact version index and a readable snapshot table.
- Kept next-step guidance for the upcoming version.

### Suggested v9 Fix Plan
1. Replace deprecated dataset loading path (remove `trust_remote_code` dependence).
2. Add a local dataset cache/fallback for reproducible offline runs.
3. Re-validate Sinhala multilingual mapping quality and threshold messaging.
4. Persist a machine-readable run report (`.json`) for every full training run.

## Owner Pending Note
> "not yet pls fix by agent and dump it as next version"

Status: **This document formatting is now fixed and ready for the next version entry (v9).**

## v9 (Agent Draft) — Error-Fix Upgrade Plan

### Goal
Create **SEOL AF v9** by fixing the concrete issues observed in v8 and adding more natural emotional persistence.

### Confirmed Problems from v8
1. Dataset loader break: `trust_remote_code` path failed for `daily_dialog`.
2. Sinhala mapping score below target (`0.485` vs desired `>= 0.60`).
3. Negative emotional transitions reset too quickly (`insult -> Mother -> Neutral`).
4. Character consistency drift in some outputs (defensive/constraint-like tone vs intended romantic persona).

### v9 Changelog (planned fixes)
- **Data pipeline fix**
  - Remove `trust_remote_code=True` flow.
  - Load dataset from parquet/arrow exports (or local cache) for stable training.
- **Multilingual quality fix**
  - Add Sinhala + code-switch fine-tuning samples.
  - Track Sinhala/English alignment metric each run and fail check if below target.
- **Emotional persistence fix**
  - Add inertia mechanism so strong emotions decay gradually across turns.
  - Proposed blend: `emotion_t = 0.7 * emotion_{t-1} + 0.3 * input_t`.
- **Bio-state realism fix**
  - Add delayed cortisol/adrenaline spikes for high-conflict prompts.
  - Avoid instant neutral reset after severe negative user input.
- **Persona consistency fix**
  - Tighten response shaping so character remains consistent with SEOL role.
  - Add post-response guardrail checks for style/persona drift.
- **Memory weighting fix**
  - Prioritize emotionally intense turns over neutral turns in short-term memory updates.
- **Conflict engine extension**
  - Add controlled response diversity (comfort / boundary / assertive reactions).

### v9 Validation Checklist
- Dataset loads without `trust_remote_code` errors.
- Sinhala similarity score reaches target threshold (`>= 0.60`).
- Negative-turn test shows non-instant emotional decay (no abrupt full reset).
- Persona consistency passes scripted multi-turn evaluation.
- Run summary JSON saved with metrics, warnings, and per-turn bio-state deltas.

## V9 vs V8 — What Was Missing & What Was Fixed

### ❌ Missing in v9 (now restored)

| Missing piece | Impact | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `BIO_CHANNELS`, `BIO_IDX`, `COMMAND_TO_BIO`, `BIO_ANTI_PAIRS` | Entire training pipeline would crash at first reference | Added full bio constants cell |
| `TEMPLATES` + `rule_label()` + `ANGER_KEYWORDS` / `DESPAIR_KEYWORDS` | No real dataset labelling possible; v8's "fuck you → Alert not Neutral" fix was lost | Ported fully from v8 |
| Full `AFState` class (with `memory`, `self_correct`, `plot_history`, `save_state`, `load_state`) | v9 only had `BioStateEngineV9` (a partial, no-display engine) — no interactive state | Added complete `AFState` v9 with v9 inertia + delayed spike queue wired in |
| `EXPERT_PROMPTS_V9` + `build_system_prompt_v9()` | No MoE prompts at all — the whole personality system was gone | Added all 5 v8 experts + new **Alert** expert (6th mode, v9-only) |
| LLM setup cell (`load_llm`, embedder init, device check) | Notebook non-runnable from scratch | Added with VRAM checks and optional-load pattern |
| `seol_respond_v9()` inference pipeline | No way to run the model end-to-end | Full 10-step pipeline with PersonaGuard post-filter (v9 upgrade) |
| Multi-turn conversation test | No way to validate stateful behaviour | Ported from v8 with v9 test cases (incl. delayed spike verification) |
| Interactive chat loop | No interactive session | Full `state/history/plot/save/load/reset/log` commands |
| ONNX / session export cell | Nothing to ship | Added with TorchScript fallback |
| 8 identical appendix blocks | Useless padding | Consolidated into 1 clean utility block with `util_*` helpers |

### ✅ V9 Upgrades Kept & Enhanced

- **`V9Config` dataclass** — all hyperparams in one place
- **Router backbone upgraded** to LayerNorm + GELU (draft used plain ReLU)
- **`num_modes=6`** — Alert mode expert added
- **Delayed conflict spike queue** — anger causes cortisol/adrenaline spike on the *next* turn
- **`WeightedMemory`** — importance-scored event recall
- **`PersonaGuard`** — blocks AI-leaking phrases at inference
- **Early stopping** + structured JSON run report
- **Local-first dataset loader** (no `trust_remote_code`)
